# @ai-sdk-tools/cache

## 1.0.0

### Major Changes

- Initial release of @fondation-io fork from ai-sdk-tools

  This is the first release of the @fondation-io scoped packages, forked from midday-ai/ai-sdk-tools.

  All packages have been renamed from @ai-sdk-tools/_ to @fondation-io/_ and are now published under the fondation-io organization.

  Features:

  - Multi-agent orchestration with handoffs and routing
  - Structured artifact streaming for React components
  - Universal caching for AI tool executions
  - Development and debugging tools
  - Persistent memory system for AI agents
  - Zustand-based state management for AI applications

## 0.7.1

### Patch Changes

- Initial release of unified ai-sdk-tools package. Fixed use client directive handling in artifacts. Added artifacts devDependency to cache package.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 🎉 **Artifact Context Support**: Cache now automatically detects and preserves artifact context

  ### New Features

  - **Automatic Context Detection**: Cache automatically finds context through multiple sources:

    1. `executionOptions.writer` (direct)
    2. `experimental_context.writer` (AI SDK standard)
    3. `artifacts.getContext().writer` (artifacts context - NEW!)

  - **Database Context Preservation**: Cached tools can now access database connections and user context on both cache hits and misses

  - **Zero-Config Context Preservation**: Works with existing `setContext()` calls without requiring any changes to your code

  - **Enhanced Error Handling**: Graceful fallback when artifacts package is not available

  ### Bug Fixes

  - Fixed context-dependent tools failing on cache hits
  - Improved schema preservation for cached tools
  - Better TypeScript support for artifact context types

  This release solves the common issue where cached tools couldn't access database context or user information, making caching seamless for context-dependent tools.
